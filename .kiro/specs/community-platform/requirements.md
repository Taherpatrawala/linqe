# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Mini LinkedIn-like Community Platform that enables users to authenticate, create posts, and view profiles. The platform will be built with a Node.js/TypeScript backend using Mikro-ORM and PostgreSQL, and a Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. The system will support user registration, authentication, post creation and viewing, and profile management with both light and dark theme support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with email and password, so that I can access the platform and create posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password

3. WHEN a user provides invalid email format THEN the system SHALL validate and reject the registration
4. WHEN a user registers successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically log them in with JWT or session-based authentication
5. IF password is less than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL reject the registration with validation error

### Requirement 2: User Login System

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login with my credentials, so that I can access my account and platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides correct email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate and provide access token
2. WHEN a user provides incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL return authentication error
3. WHEN a user is successfully authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the home feed
4. WHEN authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the authentication token

### Requirement 3: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have a profile with name, email, and bio, so that other users can learn about me.

3. WHEN a user views their own profile THEN the system SHALL display name, email, and bio with edit capabilities
4. WHEN a user views another user's profile THEN the system SHALL display name and bio (email hidden)
5. IF bio exceeds 500 characters THEN the system SHALL reject the update with validation error

### Requirement 4: Post Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create text-only posts, so that I can share my thoughts with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a post with valid text content THEN the system SHALL save the post with timestamp and author information
2. WHEN a user submits an empty post THEN the system SHALL reject with validation error
3. WHEN a user creates a post THEN the system SHALL immediately display it in their profile and public feed
4. IF post content exceeds 1000 characters THEN the system SHALL reject with validation error
5. WHEN a post is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the authenticated user

### Requirement 5: Public Post Feed

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a public feed of all posts, so that I can see what the community is sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the home feed THEN the system SHALL display all posts ordered by most recent first
2. WHEN displaying posts THEN the system SHALL show author name, post content, and timestamp
3. WHEN a user clicks on an author name THEN the system SHALL navigate to that user's profile
4. WHEN the feed loads THEN the system SHALL show loading states during data fetching
5. IF there are no posts THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 6: User Profile Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view user profiles, so that I can see their information and posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a profile page THEN the system SHALL display the user's name, bio, and all their posts
2. WHEN displaying profile posts THEN the system SHALL order them by most recent first
3. WHEN a user visits their own profile THEN the system SHALL provide edit capabilities for bio
4. WHEN a profile has no posts THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
5. IF a profile doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page

### Requirement 7: Theme Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between light and dark themes, so that I can customize my viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user toggles theme preference THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the selected theme
2. WHEN a user sets a theme preference THEN the system SHALL persist the choice across sessions
3. WHEN a user first visits THEN the system SHALL respect their system theme preference as default
4. WHEN theme changes THEN the system SHALL update all UI components consistently
5. WHEN custom themes are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to select from predefined options

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I can understand and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific, user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states with retry options
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and display generic user-friendly messages
4. WHEN forms have validation errors THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide loading and error states on the frontend

### Requirement 9: Database Schema and Migrations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured database schema with migrations, so that the data is organized and the system is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN the database SHALL have proper tables for users and posts with relationships
2. WHEN schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL use Mikro-ORM migrations to update the database
3. WHEN users are created THEN the system SHALL enforce unique email constraints
4. WHEN posts are created THEN the system SHALL maintain foreign key relationships to users
5. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL use proper indexing for performance

### Requirement 10: Clean Architecture and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, scalable codebase with deployment instructions, so that the system is maintainable and deployable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is structured THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into controllers, services, entities, and routes
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN the system SHALL use modern React patterns with hooks and server actions
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide both local development and production build instructions
4. WHEN code is organized THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between backend and frontend in respective folders
5. WHEN the system runs THEN the system SHALL provide proper environment configuration for different deployment stages
